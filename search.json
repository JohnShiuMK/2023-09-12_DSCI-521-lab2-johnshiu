    "text": "Greetings,\nI appreciate your visit to this page. My name is John Shiu, and I am a student enrolled in the UBC MDS Vancouver Cohort 8 for the academic year 2023-24.\nIn addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as a Portfolio Manager at CryptAM.fund. My journey in the cryptocurrency industry commenced in 2018, and since then, I have led various teams of quantitative peers in constructing automated trading infrastructure and crafting mid/low-frequency trading strategies. Over time, our firm has accumulated a wealth of knowledge and experience in this dynamic field.\nBefore joining CryptAM, I worked as a data scientist with a primary focus on quantitative trading involving Hang Seng Index Futures and Crude Oil Futures.\nMy educational background comprises a B.Sc. and an M.Phil. in Physics, both earned from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2012 and 2014, respectively. During my academic journey, my research interests centered around Higgs Physics and Particle Phenomenology.\nOnce again, I extend my gratitude for your presence here. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to get acquainted with you, learn from your insights, and embark on a mutual journey of growth in the future."
